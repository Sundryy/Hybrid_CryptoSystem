NOTE. This project is building upon a two university assignments for the 'Cryptographic Concepts' unit. Within the branch 'University_Version' were the files submitted for assignments. Marks achieved are below.

34/35 Portfolio Part 1 (Stream cipher & Block cipher)
35/35 Portfolio Part 2 (RSA key exchange, Hash function & RSA signature)
28.5/30 Technical Report (Investigated )

I am adding features overtime and hope you will watch this page closely :)




My personal list of things I wish to do with this crypto system

1. Menu functionality for all functions to be used within a single file.
3. Add in Nonce values to stream ciphers and use objects to have multiple objects in use at once.
4. Create a version of it in c++.
5. Create a javascript version that can be accessed through a website (allows use for that server).
6. Allow files to be read from the website.
7. Practice using it with an SQL (practice coding the storing of encrypted message.)  <-- would be great practice for doing this with those frameworks
